1- TO OPEN A FILE :- 
	open () function that take arguments :-
		1- mandatory arg is a string of file complete path.
		2- optional arg is the mode of openning. (default if not setted is "r")
		3- optional arg is the encoding method.  (default value is dependant on the machine system )()
	- prefered to use the with statement to avoide close errors , the with state is 
		with open ("file_name") as "file_object" :
			"""write your code here"""
	- After the with block ends, Python automatically closes the file
		
2- TO READ A FILE AFTER OPEN IT :- 
	read() function that may take 
	
	
3- TO WRITE TO A FILE AFTER OPEN IT :-
	write("string_to_be_added") function:- 
	- RETURN:- 
		number of characters written into the file 
	- can be used into 2 modes:- 
		1- append the data to the file (by using mode='a' in open function)
		2- overwrite the data to the file  (by using mode='w' in open function)
		- both modes will create the file if not exist automatically.
		- when use the append mode >> you should add \n in the start of the appended text to add it in new line (not done by default )
		
		
4- To Read And Write Coplicated Data Structe :-
	- we use json codeing and decoding like this :-
	import json
	json.dumps(str) #return a json representation for an object
	json.dump(str,f_obj) #to write in an opened file by a json coding.
	json.loads(f_obj) #(oppsit to dumps)to return object representation from a json file.
	json.load(f_obj) #to read from a json file and Return the readed decoded text.
